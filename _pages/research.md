## Movement Ecology of Hornbills and Seed Dispersal in the Congo Basin
<img src="/images/hornbill8899-JunJul2022.gif" align="right" style="width:40%" />
Black-casqued (_Ceratogymna atrata_) and white-thighed hornbill (_Bycanistes albotibialis_) disperse the seeds of more than 50 rainforest tree species and may travel 
hundreds of kilometers during the food-lean dry season. I want to know how they track fruit resources during these long-distance movements. To this end, I am 
exploring remote sensing data from satellite and drone–especially LiDAR–as predictors of their movement decisions and seed dispersal patterns.

## Spring Bird Migration as a Mechanism for Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Dispersal
<img src="/images/WoollyAdelgid.jpg" align="left" style="width:40%" />
Hemlock woolly adelgid (_Adelges tsugae_) is an invasive insect that destroys forests of eastern and Carolina hemlock (_Tsuga canadensis_ and _T. caroliniana_, respectively), and I’m interested in how birds contribute to its expansion. My first project focused on adelgid transfer between infested branches and birds, and in 2016 and 2017 I mist-netted birds in hemlock forests and collected adelgids from their feathers from migration through the breeding season. Another experiment investigated the ability of adelgids to settle on hemlock foliage post-dispersal.

## Bird-bryophyte Interactions in Sub-Antarctic Chile
<img src="/images/UplandGoose.jpg" align="left" style="width:30%" />
This project addressed how birds disperse bryophytes in the Sub-Antarctic Magellanic Ecoregion. Moss fragments have been found in the feces of White-bellied Seedsnipes 
(_Attagis malouinus_) and Upland Geese (_Chloephaga picta_) in this region, and as part of the Sub-Antarctic Biocultural Conservation Program, I assessed the importance of bryophytes in the diets of geese and seedsnipes through visual inspection and by barcoding target bryophyte gene loci in DNA from goose feces. As a bonus, I recovered 
live tardigrades from the feces of white-bellied seedsnipe.
