I am currently a postdoc with <a href="https://davieslab.oeb.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Andrew Davies</a> at Harvard University, where I am researching animal-landscape interactions in African ecosystems. My research addresses movement ecology, remote sensing, seed dispersal, vegetation structure, and biological invasions. I have a particular fascination with animals dispersing other organisms.

I completed my PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Los Angeles, working with Professor Tom Smith. My dissertation research focused on the movement ecology of frugivores and spatial patterns of seed dispersal in rainforests of Cameroon.
