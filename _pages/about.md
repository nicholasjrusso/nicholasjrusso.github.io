I am a PhD candidate in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of California, Los Angeles, working with Professor Tom Smith. 

My research focuses on the importance of landscape structure for animal movements and the role of animals as dispersal vectors for other organisms. I am currently studying seed dispersal in rainforests of Cameroon.
